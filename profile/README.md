# OBDDimal
OBDDimal is a research effort headed by @h3ssto at the University of Ulm. Its main goal is to realize feature-model analyses by means of binary decision diagrams (BDD).ยน

Beyond this scope, the project aims at making feature-model analyses more accessible in general with hopes of facilitating exchange of models, artifacts, and tools.
